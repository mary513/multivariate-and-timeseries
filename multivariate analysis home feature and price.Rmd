#Load & examine the structure of the data
#Provide descriptive statistics of the data
#Identify if there are unreasonable values, top-coding, and bottom-coding. 
# If any of these is found, propose your strategy to handle them.

# There are no NA and no zero values. 
# Next section EDA will reveal (histograms) if there are top or bottom 
# coded values, or if there should be any such imposed.
# There seem to be outliers based on median and max:  lotsize (92681) and bdrms (6, 7)
# Later testing will reveal if they are impacting regression results

# Min lot size seems too small : test if this lot is smaller than sqrft

sum(house$lotsize < house$sqrft)
# One home is larger than its lot. Although this is possible in urban areas, 
# I would argue that a in such an analysis, we should compare similar real estate types.
# If we are comparing urban vs. suburban homes, there should be an indicator, similar to colonial
# Hence, remove this observation.

#2) Conduct univariate and mulitvariate analysis
#Conduct EDA, including both univariate and multivariate analyses, on this dataset.
#For each of the variables, discuss potential feature engineering 
#(i.e. transformation of original variables, creation of a categorical variable 
#from a numeric variable, creation of interaction among variables, etc) 
#you may perform in later regression model building steps.


# Price
# Price is right/positive skewed and log(price) corrects this. Price is not negative and
# natrually lends itself to log transformation

#hist(house$price)
#hist(log(house$price))

#hist(house$sqrft, breaks=100)
#hist(log(house$sqrft), breaks=100)

# Lotsize
# One extreme outlier over 80,000 sqft. 
# Suspicion that this outlier will impact cook's distance in regression diagnosticslater on
# Lotsize might have more significance if recoded as an ordinal variable in buckets. 
# Will explore this as needed
# Somewhat right skewed but probably no need to use log

#hist(house$lotsize, breaks=100)

# Bdrms
# There are 2 outliers for bdrms, one house with 6 and one house with 7 bdrms. 
# Later diagnostics will ascertain if these are impacting regression results.

#hist(house$bdrms, breaks=100)

# Colonial is a factor/binary variable (can be understood similar to male/female)

# No points outside of cooks distance and all variables are significant

# It has no real world interpretation as lotsize/price can't be zero
# Although sqft could be zero, if the property was land only. 

# Coef on sqrft is the amount the price changes with each additional sqrft, so for each 
# additional sqrft the price increases by .083k, or $83 dollars

# Coef on bdrms is the amount the price changes with each additional bedroom, so for each 
# additional sqrft, the price increases by 21.640k, or +$21,640 dollars

# Coef on lotsize is the amount the price changes with each additional sqrft of land, so for each 
# additional sqrft the price increases by .009k, or $9 dollars

# Respecify the model to use log(price)
# Interpret the coefficient estimate associated with the variable bdrms.

#The management suspects that colonial-style properties (variable colonial = 1) have higher prices.
#Respecify the regression above and re-estimate the regression model to address this
#Intrepret the coefficient(s) of interest.
 
# Regression indicates that on average, a colonial style home yields an 11% increase in house price. 
# Since the variable is a factor (0 or 1) the regression line for both colonial and non-colonial homes has the
# same slope, but the y-intercept will shift by the coefficient on colonial.
# The y intercept is the log, which equates to percent increase in y for each unit increase in x.
# The coef on colonial is the difference in intercepts on log(price),i.e. difference in percent price 
# betwen non-colonial and colonial homes.

# If a house is colonial, the price increases by 11% on average, significant at 5%, 
# holding bedrooms, lotsize, and sqft constant. 
# The regression lines is parallel to non-colonial, a fixed distance above it.

#5)
#The management suspects that the effect of the number of bedrooms on price is nonlinear.
#Respecify the regression above and re-estimate the regression model to address this particular question 
#Note that there are a few ways to capture nonlinear effect.
